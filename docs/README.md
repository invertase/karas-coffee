# Documentation

Kara's Coffee is a demo application built using a collection of technologies - most importantly Firebase!

These docs explain how the main aspects of the application integrate with Firebase, including Firebase Extensions.

## Technologies

### Ô∏è‚Äçüî•&nbsp;&nbsp;[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

- üîë&nbsp;&nbsp;[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
- üìÑ&nbsp;&nbsp;[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- üåç&nbsp;&nbsp;[Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;[Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions)

- [`onAuthCreate`](https://github.com/invertase/karas-coffee/blob/main/functions/src/index.ts#L45)

  - This function adds a new document to the `mail` collection on new user creation - this collection is listened to
    by the [Firestore Send Email](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/firestore-send-email) extension and
    sends a welcome email to the new user.
    - These emails are not actually processed on the hosted live demo website.

- [`onPaymentCreated`](https://github.com/invertase/karas-coffee/blob/main/functions/src/index.ts#L51)

  - This function triggers when a new customer payment has been created and sends an initial order update SMS to the user (if they've set up a
    phone number on their account - entering a user phone number is disabled on the hosted live demo website) via
    the [Twilio Send Message](https://github.com/twilio-labs/twilio-firebase-extensions/tree/main/firestore-send-twilio-message)
    extension by writing to the `messages` collection on Cloud Firestore.

    **‚ö†Ô∏è Twilio integration is currently disabled for purposes of the demo. To see information on how Twilio works, you can visit their [docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/guides/guide-to-using-the-twilio-virtual-phone).**


- [`deleteUserData`](https://github.com/invertase/karas-coffee/blob/main/functions/src/index.ts#L69)
  - This scheduled function deletes all user data every 24 hours - it is useful only for the purpose of this demo.
