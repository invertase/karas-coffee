### Scenarios Consider

1.  Client sdk to run in the test - `ratesCalculation`
2.  Cannot test webhooks or triggers, we need to put a listener on a document for changes - toxicity could be an example? `useReview`
3.  Example as to why we cannot mock multiple extension functions simultaneously - `multiple test cases`
4.  Jest cases throws some issue regaridng testing, such as using Navigation - `useCheckout`.
