Use this extension to automatically embed and query your Firestore documents with the new vector search feature!

When you install this collection you specify a collection and a document field name. Adding or updating a document with this field triggers this extension to calculate a vector embedding for the document.

This vector embedding is written back to the same document, and the document is indexed in the vector store, ready to be queried against.

The extension currently provides two ways to query:

1. A callable function (TODO: this is currently http for ease of development) which takes two parameters, `query`  and `topK`

2. You may specify a collection to write queries to, and the results of the query will be written back to documents added here (with `query` and `topK` fields)

In either case the extension defaults `topK` to the value `1` if it is omitted. 

## Index management with the index document

On installation you will be asked to provide the name of a firestore collection to keep metadata on indexes. The extension will create an index document in this collection. Upon configuring the extension (e.g to use a different model) this document will be checked to see if embeddings need updating in backfill.

### Backfill

This extension uses distributed tasks to backfill a collection and embed existing documents if this feature is enabled.
